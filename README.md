This module provides a Julia interface to
[GR](http://gr-framework.org/), a framework for
visualisation applications.

## Installation

From the Julia REPL an up to date version can be installed with:

    Pkg.add("GR")

or in the [Pkg REPL-mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/index.html#Getting-Started-1):

    add GR

The Julia package manager will download and install a pre-compiled
run-time (for your hardware architecture), if the GR software is not
already installed in the recommended locations.

## Getting started

In Julia simply type ``using GR`` and begin calling functions
in the [GR framework](http://gr-framework.org/julia-gr.html) API.

Let's start with a simple example. We generate 10,000 random numbers and
create a histogram. The histogram function automatically chooses an appropriate
number of bins to cover the range of values in x and show the shape of the
underlying distribution.

```julia
using GR
histogram(randn(10000))
```

## Using GR as backend for Plots.jl

``Plots`` is a powerful wrapper around other Julia visualization
"backends", where ``GR`` seems to be one of the favorite ones.
To get an impression how complex visualizations may become
easier with [Plots](https://juliaplots.github.io), take a look at
[these](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/generated/gr/)  examples.

``Plots`` is great on its own, but the real power comes from the ecosystem surrounding it. You can find more information
[here](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/ecosystem/).

## Alternatives

Besides ``GR`` and ``Plots`` there is a nice package called [GRUtils](https://github.com/heliosdrm/GRUtils.jl) which provides a user-friendly interface to the low-level ``GR`` subsytem, but in a more "Julian" and modular style. Newcomers are recommended to use this package. A detailed documentation can be found [here](https://heliosdrm.github.io/GRUtils.jl/stable/).

``GR`` and ``GRUtils`` are currently still being developed in parallel - but there are plans to merge the two modules in the future.

## Run-time environment

``GR.jl`` is a wrapper for the ``GR`` Framework. Therefore, the ``GR`` run-time libraries are required to use the software. These are provided via the [GR_jll.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/GR_jll.jl) package, which is an autogenerated package constructed using [BinaryBuilder](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl). This is the default setting.

Another alternative is the use of binaries from GR tarballs, which are provided directly by the GR developers as stand-alone distributions for selected platforms - regardless of the programming language. In this case, only one GR runtime environment is required for different language environments (Julia, Python, C/C++), whose installation path can be specified by the environment variable `GRDIR`.

   ```julia
   ENV["JULIA_DEBUG"] = "GR" # Turn on debug statements for the GR package
   ENV["GRDIR"] = "<path of you GR installation>" # e.g. "/usr/local/gr"
   using GR
   ```

For more information about setting up a local GR installation, see the [GR Framework](https://gr-framework.org) website.

However, if you want to permanently use your own GR run-time, you have to set the environment variable ``GRDIR`` accordingly before starting Julia, e.g.

- macOS or Linux: ```export GRDIR=/usr/local/gr```
- Windows: ```set GRDIR=C:\gr```

On Linux systems, you might also force pre-loading of the GR libraries:

```
  export LD_PRELOAD="${GRDIR}/lib/libGR.so ${GRDIR}/lib/libGR3.so ${GRDIR}/lib/libGRM.so"
```
