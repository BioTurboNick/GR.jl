# The gr (GR framework) module for Julia

This module provides a Julia interface to the
[GR framework](http://gr-framework.org/) plotting library.

You will need to have the GR framework installed on your
machine in order to use gr. Once gr is installed you can use
`Pkg.add("gr")` in Julia to install gr.

Once gr is installed you can simply type `using gr` and begin
calling functions in the [GR framework](http://gr-framework.org/gr.html) API.
