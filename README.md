# The GR module for Julia

This module provides a Julia interface to the
[GR framework](http://gr-framework.org/) graphics library.

You will need to have the GR framework installed on your
machine in order to use GR. Once GR is installed you can use
`Pkg.add("GR")` in Julia to install the GR module.

In Julia simply type `using GR` and begin calling functions
in the [GR framework](http://gr-framework.org/gr.html) API.
